Purpose: This is a game to test your math and memory fotitude. You will be given a random number to which you are attempting to make your score match. If you do so, you win the game! But be careful...if you go over the target number, you will lose. 

You add value to your score by clicking on the gem buttons. Each button will have a random value between 1-12 assigned to it, but you will not know it's value until you click it.

Whether you win or lose, you will have to option to continue playing and as long as you continue the game will keep track of your wins and losses. At the start of each new game an new target value will be created. Also, the values of the gem buttons will be different.

Useful: From a development stand point, this project help to solidify the onclick functionality. Also with it gave the opportunity to work with both javascript and jquery together.
